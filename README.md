# 👋 Hi, I'm Aghaz

Pursuing a Bachelor's in Interactive Media and Immersive Technology, specializing in Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR). I'm passionate about building immersive experiences that blend design, interaction, and real-time technology. With a strong foundation in 3D modeling and animation, I bring digital environments to life using tools like Blender, Unity, and Unreal Engine.
I'm currently exploring the intersection of XR development, computer vision, and real-time interactivity to push the boundaries of virtual experiences.
